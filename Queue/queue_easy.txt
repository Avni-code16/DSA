 Queue Implementation Practice
Now apply what youâ€™ve learned to real queue problems.

(i) Implement a Circular Queue
Fixes the issue of wasted space in static queues.

(ii) Queue Operations Using Two Stacks
Use two stacks to simulate enqueue and dequeue behavior.

(iii) Reverse First K Elements of a Queue
Use an auxiliary stack

(iv) Interleave the First Half of the Queue with the Second Half
Without using extra space (use a stack)

(v) Design a Deque (Double-ended Queue) using Array
Insert/Delete from both ends
